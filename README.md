# Leader Election Generic Implementation for TypeScript

You can ```npm install --save earlect``` to add it to your project or you can test it out on your machine by first cloning this repo, running ```npm install```, installing a passwordless nats-server (simply via brew or apt or yum) and running ```npm run dev``` in 3 terminal windows.

Have fun!
